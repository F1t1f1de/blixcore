# 🚀 Fixing Blixcore Demo Deployment

## Current Issue
The demo at https://blixcore.vercel.app/ is returning a 404 error, likely because it's deployed from an old version or different source.

## ✅ Local Testing Confirmed Working
All functionality has been tested locally and is working perfectly:

- ✅ Homepage loads correctly (200 OK response)
- ✅ Fitness-focused landing page with Australian branding
- ✅ Lead capture form working
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly:
  - `/api/leads` - GET returns mock fitness leads
  - `/api/leads` - POST creates new leads successfully  
  - `/api/leads/stats` - GET returns fitness industry analytics
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes

## 🔧 Deployment Fix Options

### Option 1: Fresh Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect new GitHub repo to Vercel
3. Deploy fresh instance

### Option 2: Update Existing Deployment
1. Connect to existing Vercel project
2. Push latest changes
3. Trigger new deployment
