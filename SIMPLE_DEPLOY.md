# ðŸš€ Simple Blixcore Deployment Guide

## Option 1: Vercel CLI (Recommended - Fastest)

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

### Step 2: Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```

### Step 3: Deploy from this directory
```bash
vercel --prod
```

That's it! Vercel will:
- Detect Next.js automatically
- Build and deploy
- Give you a live URL

---

## Option 2: GitHub + Vercel (If CLI doesn't work)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `blixcore-fitness`
3. Public repository
4. Don't initialize with README

### Step 2: Upload Code
From this directory, run:
```bash
# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blixcore-fitness.git

# Push code
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Click Deploy (no configuration needed)

---

## Option 3: Direct Upload to Vercel

1. Create a ZIP file of this entire folder (excluding node_modules and .git)
2. Go to https://vercel.com/new
3. Drag and drop the ZIP file
4. Vercel will deploy automatically
